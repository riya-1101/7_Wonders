    <h2>1.Taj Mahal - India</h2>
    <img src="https://www.worldatlas.com/r/w960-q80/upload/8e/61/15/taj-mahal-india.jpg"><p>
    <big>                 The Taj Mahal is one of the most beautiful and well-known buildings in the world. 
                         It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his late wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died giving birth to the couple’s 14th child. 
                        It is said to have taken 20,000 men and 22 years to complete.<br>
                <br>
                         The Taj Mahal is located in Agra, India, and is an example of Mughal architecture, which combines Indian, Persian, and Islamic influences.
                          This glorious structure is made of marble and has a main tomb chamber with a sarcophagus. It also includes a gigantic garden with a reflecting pool.<br>
                <br>   
                         The Taj Mahal is considered a symbol of love and peace and it is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site
    </big></p>
                
    <h2>2.Chichen Itza  - Mexico </h2>
                <img src="https://www.worldatlas.com/r/w960-q80/upload/65/3e/68/chichen-itza-mexico.jpg"> <p>
     <big>               Chichen Itza is located in Mexico and was built by the Mayan people. 
                         The Mayan people were a very advanced civilization, and their architecture is unbelievable.
                         The Chichen Itza temple stands 79 feet above the main plaza and was built in such a way that it aligns with the sun during the spring and autumn equinoxes.
                         During these equinoxes, the sun shines directly on the pyramid and casts a shadow in the shape of a snake. It is truly an amazing sight to see.
                <br>
                         The Mayans were very advanced for their time. 
                         They practiced agriculture, astronomy, and mathematics.
                         They also built cities and lived in houses that had running water. 
                         The Mayan civilization was very successful until it eventually disappeared from the earth around the 11th century.
                         The reasons for this are unknown, but it has been speculated that the Mayans may have perished due to wars or were wiped out by the disturbances in their trade routes.

                <h2>3.Colosseum - Italy</h2>
                    <img src="https://www.worldatlas.com/r/w960-q80/upload/0d/93/6f/colosseum-italy.jpg"><p>
     <big>
                         The Colosseum in Italy was built in 70 and 80 AD and was the largest amphitheater in the world.
                         This magnificent structure is made of concrete and stone and is considered one of the greatest achievements of Roman architecture.<br>
                <br>         

                         Every year, millions of tourists visit the Colosseum to see its grandeur for themselves.
                         It measures 620 by 513 feet, which is larger than an American football field! It is also estimated that over 50,000 people could be seated in the Colosseum at one time.<br>
                <br>

                         The Colosseum was used for gladiator fights and public spectacles such as mock sea battles, animal hunts, executions, and re-enactments of famous battles and dramas.
                         On average, it is estimated that 550,000 people were killed in the Colosseum,
                         and so many animals died that some species even became extinct.

                <h2>5.Machu Picchu - Peru</h2>
                <img src="https://www.worldatlas.com/r/w960-q80/upload/76/9f/64/machu-picchu-peru.jpg">

                           Machu Picchu is an ancient Incan city that is located in present-day Peru.
                            The city was built in the 15th century and is situated on a mountain ridge above the Urubamba River valley.
                             Machu Picchu is one of the most well-known and popular tourist destinations in Peru, as well as being one of the Seven Wonders of the World.<br>


                <br>
                          The city was built around 1450, but it was abandoned just a century later at the time of the Spanish conquest.
                           The Incas never revealed their location to the Spanish conquerors, so Machu Picchu was undiscovered for almost 400 years. When Machu Picchu was rediscovered in 1911, it became one of the most famous archaeological sites in South America.
                           The site is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site and receives approximately half a million visitors each year.

                <h2>6.Petra - Jordan</h2>
                <img src="https://www.worldatlas.com/r/w960-q80/upload/74/2e/b4/petra-jordan.jpg">
                <p>
     <big>
                            As one of the oldest cities in the world, Petra is an archaeological wonder in Jordan.
                           It is believed to have been the site where Moses struck a rock and water flowed forth. Later on, in 300 BC, it was established by the Nabataean Arabs.
                            During this time, Petra thrived, and it became an essential trade hub, particularly for spices.
                           The buildings in Petra are carved from sandstone, and the city contains many rock-cut temples, tombs, and other structures.
                          The structures are designed to let the light shine into the interiors of the buildings.<br><br>

                           The city eventually fell, however, as trade routes changed and two major earthquakes, (363 and 551, respectively) caused more complexity, Petra was eventually abandoned.<br><br>
        
                         The city was hidden for centuries by the surrounding cliffs and was only rediscovered in 1812 by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt.
                         Petra is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and one of the Seven Wonders of the World.

                <h2>7.Great Wall Of China - China</h2>
                <img src="https://www.worldatlas.com/r/w960-q80/upload/f5/5d/5b/great-wall-of-china-china.jpg">
                <p>
    <big>
                           The Great Wall of China is the largest man-made structure in the world stretching over 5,000 miles long. Construction on the wall commenced in the 7th century BC and continued for 2 millennia.<br> <br>

                         The Great Wall was first conceived during the reign of the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang Di, although it was actually built in many parts by different emperors.
                           In the Qin Dynasty, the emperor ordered thousands of soldiers to build a wall that would stretch across China.
                         After the fall of the Qin Dynasty, the Northern Wei Dynasty restored and expanded the remaining wall to guard against assaults from other tribes. 
                          From there, many kingdoms and dynasties throughout the millennia helped repair and finish this magnificent structure.<br><br>
        
                         There are many stories about why the wall was built.
                           Some say that it was built to prevent attacks by fierce nomadic tribes from the north.
                           Others think that it was built to keep out armies of invaders. However, academics have stated that it worked more as “political propaganda.”

                          Today, the Great Wall is a popular tourist attraction in China and thousands of people flock to it each year.
